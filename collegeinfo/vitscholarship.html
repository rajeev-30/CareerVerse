    <p>Each year, Vellore Institute of Technology offers scholarships in the form of tuition waivers and freeships.
        While merit scholarships are awarded to class toppers, economically challenged students are provided need-based
        financial assistance. Furthermore, NRI and foreign students are given scholarships upon presenting meritorious
        records. Students from rural backgrounds who secure top ranks in VITEEE at the district level (in Tamil Nadu
        only) are given free education.

    </p>
    <p>Students who wish to pursue MTech are also given scholarships, given that they score well in the GATE exam. In
        addition, scholarships are given to students who excel in sports and games. Financial assistance is also
        provided to students who wish to do their project work in partner universities and institutions abroad, under
        the Semester Abroad Programme (SAP). In order to encourage the students to pursue active research, VIT also
        awards appropriate research associateships to meritorious and needy students.
