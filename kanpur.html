                    <br><br>1) Up to 25% of the students in a batch may be awarded the MCM scholarship. From the total
                    number of MCM
                    Scholarships available in each batch, 20% shall be reserved for students belonging to the SC/ST
                    category. The
                    SC/ST students are not to be compared with the GN/OBC students.
                    <br>2) The MCM scholarships unutilized in a batch may be transferred to another batch. Similarly,

                    allowance is
                    withdrawn.
                    <br>4) For the first-year UG students, common JEE-AIR or marks obtained will be used for awarding
                    the MCM
                    scholarship.
                    <br>5) A student must not have had an 'F' grade(s) in one or more courses in the last two regular
                    semesters to
                    receive the MCM scholarship.
                    <br>6) Total Family Annual Income (TFAI) of the student from all sources should be less than 6.0
                    lacs.
                    <br>br
                    7) The student must not be getting any other scholarship either from IIT Kanpur or from any other
